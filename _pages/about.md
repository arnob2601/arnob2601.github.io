I am Raihan. I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [George Mason University (GMU)](https://www.gmu.edu/). Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assisstant in the RAIL group under the super vision of [Dr. Gregory J. Stein](https://cs.gmu.edu/~gjstein/).

I obtained my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from [Islamic University of Technology (IUT)](https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/), Bangladesh, in 2016. I joined IUT as a Lecturer in the Department of CSE, where I worked until December 2019. I have completed my Masters Degree in Computer Science from GMU in 2023 and I am continuing to work towards my Ph.D here as well.

My research interest involes making robot efficiently operate in partially known environments. This composites my fiddling space to robotics, planning under uncertainty, and machine learning.

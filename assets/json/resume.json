      "summary": "In this paper we address the task of long-horizon navigation in partially mapped environments for which active gathering of information about faraway unseen space is essential for good behavior. We present a novel planning strategy that, at training time, affords tractable computation of the value of information associated with revealing potentially informative regions of unseen space, data used to train a graph neural network to predict the goodness of temporally-extended exploratory actions. Our learning-augmented model-based planning approach predicts the expected value of information of revealing unseen space and is capable of using these predictions to actively seek information and so improve long-horizon navigation."
